#Toorguide

##Overview

Toorguide is a web application for creating website tutorials, walkthroughs, help systems and presentations.  Toorguide has two separate components:

1) The Toorguide recorder, which is used to add tour listeners to a page.

2) The Toorguide player, which listens and responds to existing tour nodes.

The Toorguide server stores the nodes, acts as a safety valve for the recorder, and presents the Toorguide menus for your site while in recorder mode.

This repository is for both the server- and client-side aspects of Toorguide.

This is where the pipe-dream goes.
