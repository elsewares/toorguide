#Toorguide

##Overview

Toorguide is a web application for creating website tutorials, walkthroughs, help systems and presentations.  Toorguide has two separate components:

1) The Toorguide client, which consists of the Toor recorder (recortoor?) for creating tours on your site, and the Toor player (playtoor?), which adds event listeners to the page and waits, like a nuclear submarine.  The client will be dependent on jQuery (>1.3.6), and may use web workers, if I'm feeling brave.

2) The Toorguide server, which stores the nodes, acts as a safety valve for the recorder, and presents the Toorguide menus for the site while in recorder mode.

This repository is for both the server- and client-side aspects of Toorguide.

##Spitballing

This is where the pipe-dream goes.
